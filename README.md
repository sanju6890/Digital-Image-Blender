# Digital-Image-Blender
A digital image blender project developed using opevCV library.
This project is developed on a simple mathematical function  h(x)=(1-a)*f(x)+a*g(x) where value of a varies between(0.0-1.0).
We get the extent of blended result depending upon the output of given function as the value of a is changed in the specified range.
The prerequisites for the programme is images should be of the same size(Dimensions) and format(jpg, png, etc).
